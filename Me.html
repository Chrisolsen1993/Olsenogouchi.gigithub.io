<div><img src="img/mee.jpeg" alt="My image"></div>

  <p> My name is Olsen Ogouchi.
  I've just started my journey as a web delopper.
  I am a curious person who love to discorver new things.
  I also love sports such as soccer and American football.
  In my free time you will see me coding or either playing video games.
  Thank you.<br/>
  My journey as a learner started back in 2011 when i graduated
  from high school  and starded college.
  Hear are a few technologies i had worked with in the past:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript </li>
    <li>HTML & CSS</li>
    <li> PHP</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
  </ul>

<p>Recently I've just join <a href='https://www.digitalcrafts.com/'>Digital Crafts</a> comunity as a student
  to refresh my mind and to learn more about web develpment.
